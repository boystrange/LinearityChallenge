This is a solution in Agda of the [linearity
challenge](https://concurrentbenchmark.github.io) for the finite
fragment of **Ï€LIN** presented by [Ciccone and
Padovani](http://dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.CONCUR.2022.36). In
addition to the [safety property](Safety.lagda.md), the solution
also proves two [deadlock freedom results](DeadlockFreedom.lagda.md)
as well as soundness of the subsumption rule for the **logical
subtyping** of session types defined by [Horne and
Padovani](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jlamp.2024.100986).
